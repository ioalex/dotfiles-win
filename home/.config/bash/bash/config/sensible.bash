## GENERAL OPTIONS ##

# Prevent file overwrite on stdout redirection
# Use `>|` to force redirection to an existing file
set -o noclobber

# Update window size after every command
shopt -s checkwinsize

# Automatically trim long paths in the prompt (requires Bash 4.x)
PROMPT_DIRTRIM=2

# Enable history epansion with space
# E.g. typing !!<space> will replace the !! with your last command
bind Space:magic-space

# Turn on recursive globbing (enables ** to recurse all directories)
shopt -s globstar 2> /dev/null

# Case-insensitive globbing (used in pathname expansion)
shopt -s nocaseglob;

## SMARTER TAB-COMPLETION (Readline bindings) ##

# Perform file completion in a case insensitive fashion
bind "set completion-ignore-case on"

# Treat hyphens and underscores as equivalent
bind "set completion-map-case on"

# Display matches for ambiguous patterns at first tab press
bind "set show-all-if-ambiguous on"

# Immediately add a trailing slash when autocompleting symlinks to directories
bind "set mark-symlinked-directories on"

## BETTER DIRECTORY NAVIGATION ##

# Prepend cd to directory names automatically
shopt -s autocd 2> /dev/null
# Correct spelling errors during tab-completion
shopt -s dirspell 2> /dev/null
# Correct spelling errors in arguments supplied to cd
shopt -s cdspell 2> /dev/null

# This defines where cd looks for targets
# Add the directories you want to have fast access to, separated by colon
# Ex: CDPATH=".:~:~/projects" will look for targets in the current working directory, in home and in the ~/projects folder
CDPATH="."

# This allows you to bookmark your favorite places across the file system
# Define a variable containing a path and you will be able to cd into it regardless of the directory you're in
shopt -s cdable_vars
